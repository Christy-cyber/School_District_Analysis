# School District Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
### Metrics
Budgetary data along with reading and math scores were analyzed for 9th-12th graders at 15 high schools in this educational district.  The following metrics were requested:
- Total budget per school
- Per student budget
- Average math scores
- Average reading scores
- Percent of students passing math >= 70
- Percent of students passing reading >= 70
- Percent of students passing both math and reading >= 70

### Deliverables
The following deliverables were requested based on the metrics calculated above:
 - Metrics by district
 - Metrics by school
 - Metrics by top five highest and lowest performing schools
 - Average math and reading scores by grade for each school
 - Math and reading scores, and percent of students passing, by per capita spending
 - Math and reading scores, and percent of students passing, by school size
 - Math and reading scores, and percent of students passing, by school type (public vs. charter)

### Reevaluation of the Metrics
Evidence of academic dishonesty was found for 9th grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School.  In order to uphold state testing standards, a reevaluation of the metrics was performed.  Ninth grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School were subsequently replaced with "Not a Number" (NaN) and the metrics and deliverables were recalculated and reconstructed, respectively.  Results shown below indicate the before and after findings once the scores were replaced.
